== About ==
PDNSOps2 is a Web-based application which aids in administrator of domains and 
records for PowerDNS running the MySQL and PostgreSQL backend. PDNSOps2 is 
targeted mainly toward the individual domain owners and small businesses, but 
should be robust enough to be used in a larger capacity by an ISP or large big 
host. For those who may not know, PowerDNS is a domain name server application,
much like BIND, but offering alternative backends for the storage of domain 
information.

PDNSOps2 is a complete, ground up, rewrite of the original PDNSOps (Formery
PDNSAdministrator) code base.  Mk 2 is based on the Yii Framework and uses PHP
PDO to better support all potential database backends.
